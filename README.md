<h1>Western Endless runner</h1>

Welcome to Western Endless Runner! This game is a Western-themed endless runner, where youâ€™ll navigate through procedurally generated environments while avoiding obstacles and collecting bottles. It's a fun and challenging game set in the rugged world of the Wild West.
Features

    Procedural Generation: The game generates new running sections on the fly, creating endless possibilities for each playthrough.

    Dynamic Obstacles: Obstacles are spawned randomly during gameplay. These obstacles disappear after a few seconds to optimize memory usage.

    Section Tracker: A tracker keeps track of the number of sections currently in the scene, ensuring smooth transitions and memory management.

    Collision Detection: Players need to avoid collisions with obstacles, as colliding with them will result in a game over.

    Bottle Collection: Players can collect bottles scattered throughout the level. Each bottle collected increases the bottle count displayed on the UI, giving the player a sense of accomplishment.
